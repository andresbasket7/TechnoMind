                    <p><strong><em>Abstract</em>—Technology is an extremely potent tool that can be
                    leveraged for human development and social good. Owing to the
                    great importance of environment and human psychology in driving
                    human behavior, and the ubiquity of technology in modern
                    life, there is a need to leverage the insights and capabilities of
                    both fields together for nudging people towards a behavior that
                    is optimal in some sense (personal or social). In this regard,
                    the field of persuasive technology, which proposes to infuse
                    technology with appropriate design and incentives using insights
                    from psychology, behavioral economics, and human-computer
                    interaction holds a lot of promise. Whilst persuasive technology
                    is already being developed and is at play in many commercial
                    applications, it can have the great social impact in the field of
                    Information and Communication Technology for Development
                    (ICTD) which uses Information and Communication Technology
                    (ICT) for human developmental ends such as education and
                    health. In this paper we will explore what persuasive technology
                    is and how it can be used for the ends of human development.
                    To develop the ideas in a concrete setting, we present a case
                    study outlining how persuasive technology can be used for human
                    development in Pakistan, a developing South Asian country, that
                    suffers from many of the problems that plague typical developing
                    country.</strong></p>

                <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>The change of human mind to behave positively in situations
                has always been the target of many researchers.
                The domain of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)—which
                leverages techniques from computer science and several other
                disciplines like human behavior, psychology and cognitive
                science—focuses on the design of technology so that human
                computer interaction becomes as intuitive and user friendly
                as possible. The interaction provides a powerful means for
                creating a strong bond between the two entities. Embodied
                agents are one of the major areas where the principles of HCI
                are implemented as embodied agents aim to provide users
                with much interactions, which is provided in the fields of
                health, education and learning, video games and some military
                applications <a href="#reference5">[5]</a>.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we are focusing on the use of <em>“persuasive
                technology”</em>—which refers to technology that is designed to
                persuade humans by changing their attitude and influencing
                their minds regarding various matters (economical, medical, or
                personal) using technological resources <a href="#reference18">[18]</a>—for human development.
                In particular, we are interested in using persuasive
                technology to influence people <em>voluntarily</em> towards pro-social
                behaviors and away from anti-social behaviors<a href="#reference24">[24]</a> . We note
                that the act of persuasion is starkly different from a forceful
                implementation or coercion through the use of warnings or
                fear. The act of persuasion is also expected to follow some
                ethical guidelines and avoid any deception to achieve some
                target. Persuasive technology is broadly applicable and can
                be applied to commerce, education and learning, safety, environmental
                preservation, occupational effectiveness, preventive
                health-care, fitness and well-being, disease management, personal
                finance, community involvement, personal relationship,
                personal management and self improvement <a href="#reference18">[18]</a>.</p>
                <p>The rise of Facebook, Twitter and other digital social media
                websites is a testament to the potency of technology to
                persuade people to buy, sell or engage in certain behaviors. The
                use of persuasive technology is on the rise in multiple domains
                where technology can be used as an effective medium to nudge
                human behavior. In this regard, a new field of study called
                <em>“Captology”</em>, a term coined by Stanford researcher BJ Fogg
                <a href="#reference17">[17]</a>, has been proposed which focuses on the design, research
                and analysis of interactive computing products created for
                the purpose of changing people’s attitudes or behaviors. Web
                browsers are being used as a medium for behavior change
                interventions through the use of subliminal priming. For example,
                <em>Subly</em>, a Chrome browser extension, primes behavioral
                concepts through emphasis on words or phrases when people
                are browsing the internet  <a href="#reference9">[9]</a>. Similarly online tools are being
                developed that increase engagement by learning about energy
                awareness  <a href="#reference22">[22]</a>.Furthermore, persuasive technology can also
                be deployed to break undesirable habits. For example, Wood
                and Neal suggest a strategy known as “vigilant monitoring”
                which brings together conscious thoughts of control as well
                as automatic process in the brain  <a href="#reference52">[52]</a>.</p>
                <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
                has studied the applications of persuasive technology for
                human development in the context of a case study of a
                developing country. In this regard, we first present a general
                discussion of the various application areas in which persuasive
                technology can help modify human behavior towards positive
                social outcomes in developing countries, and then anchor the
                discussion in a concrete setting by discussing the case of
                Pakistan, a developing country in South Asia. Before going
                any further, we discuss the organization of the paper in what
                follows. Section II provides the background study of related
                fields and designing of technology. In Section III, a thorough
                explanation of applications that involve persuasive technology
                is given, Section IV elaborates case studies with context to
                Pakistan and how behavior change through technology can
                have positive impact on people. In Section V, we discuss some
                of the future opportunities and pitfalls in the area of persuasive
                technology and finally Section VI provides the conclusion of
                the paper.</p>

                    <h2>II. BACKGROUND</h2>
                    <h3>A. Related Fields</h3>
                    <p>In this section, we elaborate several domains from the fields
                    of social sciences, psychology and economics that are focused
                    on engendering behavioral changes in humans for their welfare
                    and for better life styles.</p> 
                    <h4>1) Affective Computing:</h4>
                    <p>In order to build technology with
                    human-like emotions and behavior, there is a need to build
                    computers intelligent enough to act and behave like human
                    beings while making decisions about their daily life routines.
                    To achieve this purpose a new domain in computer science
                    known as <em>Affective Computing</em> can be very useful as it is
                    aimed to empower computers with abilities similar to human
                    behaviors <a href="#reference51">[51]</a>. Computers need to have the recognizing ability
                    and express the emotions naturally like humans <a href="#reference35">[35]</a>. There are
                    certain applications available for computer-assisted learning,
                    perceptual information retrieval, arts and entertainment, human
                    health and interaction.
                    <h4>2) Nudge Theory/ Libertarian Paternalism:</h4> 
                    <p>Nudge theory focuses on developing a choice architecture so that users are
                    inclined towards making the right or beneficial choice in a
                    particular situation <a href="#reference41">[41]</a>. According to Richard Thaler and
                    Cass Sunstein, two behavioral economists who founded this
                    theory, human beings are prone to make mistakes, but they
                    can make better decisions if they are given good choices (and
                    particularly, good defaults) <a href="#reference39">[39]</a>. For example, according to
                    one study, when people were provided with a comparison of
                    their consumption of electricity with average user consumption
                    on their electricity bills, the one who had high electricity
                    consumption restricted themselves to achieve a lower consumption
                    in order to receive low cost of electricity <a href="#reference39">[39]</a>.
                    Another example of nudge theory at work is the website called
                    Stikk, <sup><button onclick="open_footnote_1()">1</button></sup>
                    <span class="footnote" id="first_footnote" style="display:none;"><sup>1</sup><a href="https://www.stickk.com/">http://www.stickk.com/</a></span>
                    which helps to achieve personal goals (such as losing
                    weight, quitting smoking, staying healthier, etc.). Once we set
                    some goal, like to jog three times a day, we have to put some
                    money at stake and if we fail to meet our own set target,
                    all money would be donated to any charity organization. It
                    also features to invite our friends who can become referee to
                    monitor the accuracy.
                    Using GPS technology and sensors in smartphones, tailored
                    nudges can be given to individuals on the basis of their
                    physical proximity to locations that are typically associated
                    with unwanted habits such as fast-food restaurants or by
                    identification of certain daily habits such as watching TV or
                    sitting at the same location for more than what is desirable.
                    These nudges can be in the form of simple reminders such as
                    “Don’t Go” or “Order this and not that”. There is an ongoing
                    debate on whether the nudges are a useful way to improve
                    health sector as many of the libertarians do not believe in it,
                    or it is hard to make them realize that nudging the behavior
                    is a useful way to promote healthier life since they believe
                    that many people do not know what is best for them. It also
                    contradicts the psychology of libertarian people as they argue
                    that nudge theory limits the freedom of choices <a href="#reference49">[49]</a>. Sunstein
                    offers a counter-view by arguing that choice architectures are
                    embedded implicitly in all decisions and discusses various
                    ethical issues related to nudge theory in detail <a href="#reference42">[42]</a>, some of
                    these issues are discussed later in paper.</p> 
                    <h4>3) Positive Psychology and Positive Computing:</h4> 
                    <p>Positive Computing is defined as a field which combines human
                    psychology, HCI, neuroscience, social sciences, behavioral
                    economics and education to implant new methods of creating
                    technology that can foster psychological well-being in humans.
                    This new era of technology helps in making perfect decisions
                    and support abilities for a positive change in people <a href="#reference8">[8]</a>, like
                    changing people attitudes towards goal setting to quit smoking
                    habits or setting goals to loose weight using website like Stikk.</p> 
                    <h4>4) Behavioral Economics:</h4> 
                    <p>Human minds tend to behave in a biased manner naturally which is rational thinking and
                    in contrast to this rational behavior, there is another process
                    of thinking called intuitive thinking process as described by
                    Kahneman in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” <a href="#reference25">[25]</a>. The
                    behavioral economics, which is a sub domain of psychology
                    and economics, tends to measure this quality of making
                    rational choices in certain areas where people make choices
                    from the available options in their own interests <a href="#reference20">[20]</a>. The aim
                    of persuasive technology is same that using the technology we
                    can limit user to choose best among choices available.</p> 

                    <h3> Design of Persuasive Technology</h3>
                    <p>Technology has an impact on people’s behavior. The challenge
                    is how to design technology that can be accepted by
                    user and also it amends their behavior for a positive change.
                    The user acceptance is very important because the technology
                    that is to be designed is not only to be used by users but
                    it must change people’s attitude and behavior towards some
                    recognized goal. There are many concerns about the user
                    acceptance of technology as changing the behavior by use of
                    technology might encounter several ethical issues like privacy
                    of sharing user personal data.
                    In <a href="#reference15">[15]</a>, the authors have discussed two methodological
                    frameworks to enable persuasive technology development. One
                    is <em>Value Sensitive Design (VSD)</em> and second one is <em>Participatory
                    Design (PD)</em>. In Value Sensitive Design, the designers
                    are acknowledged with human value, their privacy and their
                    autonomous behavior while in Participatory development, the
                    designers themselves are equal stakeholders and are complete
                    participants throughout the process of designing of technology.
                    Both these frameworks can be applied to ensure a persuasive
                    design for a new technology that can positively change people’s
                    attitude.
                    Don Norman in his book “Emotional Design” <a href="#reference31">[31]</a> explains
                    more about designing of technology. It is argued that there is a
                    relation between human cognition and emotions in the design
                    of technology apart from logical design against usability of the</p>
                    <img class="" src="imgarticles/Development-Phases-of-Persuasive-Systems.png" alt="Development Phases of Persuasive Systems">

                    <p>product being designed for the users. The author claims that
                    design that is attractive for users always ends up having more
                    productive outcome as people are now relaxed towards the
                    usage of technology. Norman discussed three levels of design
                    namely <em>visceral</em>, <em>behavioral</em> and <em>reflective</em>. <em>Visceral</em> identifies
                    the inward feelings of humans, the <em>behavioral</em> stage identifies
                    the feelings of people and about the usability of designed
                    product and the <em>reflective</em> design relates to the overall impact
                    of designed product to the customers
                    Another approach is “Persuasive Systems Design” (PSD),
                    which represents a framework which describes what type of
                    persuasive content is implemented and also it elaborates the
                    contents and design of the final product as well <a href="#reference32">[32]</a>. PSD
                    is the process which describes how a persuasive system can
                    be designed and also evaluates the system in context of its
                    functionality for the users. The study explains the three major
                    steps of developing of persuasive systems as shown in the
                    <a href="#persuasive_sys_phases">figure 1</a>. The first stage is about understanding the key issues
                    in designing of a persuasive system before its implementation.
                    In the second stage, the context of persuasive system are to be
                    examined. And in the final stage, the actual system is being
                    implemented containing all the major aspects identified earlier.
                    To promote a healthier lifestyle for people who avoid exercising
                    and neglect physical activities in their daily life, there
                    are many solutions where persuasive technology can be used.
                    One such study was conducted by researchers in which they
                    designed the persuasive technology to help promoting physical
                    activities. Using the existing design models, the authors have
                    proposed a new model, based on previous work regarding
                    persuasion to design system named, <em>UbiFit Garden</em> system
                    that aims to encourage physical activities among people using
                    their smartphones <a href="#reference14">[14]</a>.</p>

                    <h2>III. APPLICATION OF PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <p>In this section, we will elaborate different domains in which
                    the persuasive technology is being used in everyday fields such
                    as health, education, physical activities, childcare, farming,
                    energy usage, and fraud detection, etc. This section elaborates
                    already implemented solutions to improve public interest using
                    technology and persuasion.
                    <h3>A. Health</h3>
                    <p>There is numerous work that is aimed to provide a healthier
                    lifestyle for people and the role of information technology
                    has played a vital part to give people healthier lifestyle by
                    providing them with multiple applications for better health
                    care. One of the most common approach is to provide people
                    with choices, where they can choose a healthier option from
                    multiple choices given to them and then feedback is provided
                    on the choice made. In <a href="#reference26">[26]</a>, the authors have presented how
                    they can promote the user to make choices which are in their    
                    own benefit, which is also the aim of behavioral economics
                    where we are provided with certain choices and we will choose
                    what is suitable for our own self. For the purpose of achieving
                    their target, they conducted different experiments to study the
                    effect of behavioral economics design and then tested to verify
                    a positive change.
                    Another example where Information and Communication
                    Technologies (ICTs) can be used is to provide women in
                    India’s slum areas with the information regarding child birth.
                    The persuasion behind the defined approach is to provide
                    speech-based information on mobile phones, to females so
                    that it will influence the way by which most women face
                    complications during the process of child birth <a href="#reference38">[38]</a>. One way
                    to change behavior and adopt healthier lifestyle is that government
                    imposes rules and regulations, for example enforcing
                    high taxes on purchase of smoking products to avoid the illness
                    caused by it, but the study of behavioral change tends to show
                    that there can be other ways rather than just forcing to make
                    choices for the well-being of people. One way to eradicate
                    this problem is by giving incentives to people, For example
                    in USA, people who were given $750 per annum were three
                    times more likely to quit smoking rather than those not given
                    this incentive <a href="#reference7">[7]</a>. Another approach to handle the same issue
                    of smoking cessation is by signing contracts in presence of
                    other individuals which caused positive changes.
                    Another major health issue is being overweight and obese
                    (e.g., about six out of every ten adults are overweight) <sup><button onclicK="open_footnote_2()">2</button></sup>
                    <span class="footnote" id="second_footnote" style="display:none"><sup>2</sup><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/125741/six-overweight-obese.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/125741/six-overweight-obese.aspx</a></span>
                    due to poor eating habits. Even though most people understand
                    that eating fruits and fresh vegetables is beneficial for their
                    health, still a large group of people fail to purchase fruits and
                    vegetables when shopping. The use of behavioral insights and
                    nudge theory can help direct people’s eating behavior towards
                    more healthier options. In an experiment, a university student
                    designed the shopping trolley in such a way that it contains a
                    yellow tape which divides the trolley in two sections, one for
                    fruits and vegetables and other for remaining shopping items.
                    Using this approach, there was a large increase in the amount
                    of fruit and vegetables purchased by shoppers <a href="#reference43">[43]</a>.
                    There are many other examples in which human behavior is
                    changed using nudges, which is defined as making the person
                    do some activity without forcing them to do that action. In
                    health care and hygiene, the nudge theory can be implemented
                    to provide better and healthier lifestyle. To encourage hygiene
                    and avoid spillage in public toilets, a simple idea was to place
                    a sticker of fly at appropriate place on men urinal so that
                    it can become target for the person and it will ultimately
                    avoid spillage on toilet floor. This approach, as it seems
                    to be very simple and also humorous, tends to reduce the
                    spillage to about 80%. Another important strategy of nudge is
                    providing less variety of food at cafeteria would make people
                    eat less junk food and more healthier food which is limited
                    in the menu of cafeteria <a href="#reference34">[34]</a>. Some other methodologies for
                    using nudges for better and healthier life (such as providing
                    incentives, setting good defaults, salient and effect, social
                    norms, subconsciousness and commitments) are described in
                    <a href="#reference6">[6]</a>.</p>
                    <h3>B. Encouraging Physical Activity </h3>
                    <p>Today smartphones serve as an inlet to a person’s mind
                    and can be a potent tool for influencing a person. There are
                    number of applications available that let the user interact with
                    them to gain some benefit out of it. The persuasion theory can
                    be applied to design such applications which promote physical
                    activities in humans, one such example is <em>Chick Clique</em>, which
                    is a smartphone application that targets teenage girls who
                    are cautious about gaining more weight and trying to loose
                    weight using different techniques. This applications provides
                    then with goals and information regarding their diet and also
                    let teenage girls to socialize their activities to foster positive
                    behavioral change <a href="#reference46">[46]</a>.
                    A system involves designing using persuasive technology is
                    <em>Fit4life</em>, which is an iPhone application based on Persuasive
                    System Design Model that is aimed to fight obesity in America
                    (one of the main problems that afflict that region). It helps to
                    determine calories in food eaten, an earphone which allows
                    to directly communicate with the user, a heart rate monitor
                    to check heart rate of the user and a sensor which is usually
                    worn on toe to check current metabolic rate of user <a href="#reference36">[36]</a>.
                    Human beings are keen to set goals in their daily life
                    and indulge themselves in achieving those goals. The same
                    idea is behind the application <em>UbiFit</em>, which is a system that
                    allows user to monitor their physical activities themselves
                    using mobile phones. The main idea encouraging persuasion is
                    setting of goals by user themselves and trying to achieve them
                    daily as they are committed towards their own goals <a href="#reference13">[13]</a>.</p>
                    <h3>C. Education</h3>
                    <p>Persuasive technology can be applied to education sector
                    as well to change the thinking of students at school level by
                    changing the school setting positively. In <a href="#reference30">[30]</a>, the authors have
                    developed an application that focus on instructional design in
                    making learning for children more effective. The idea was to
                    develop persuasive environment for children suffering from
                    autism, a development disorder that appears about the age
                    of three causing children to loose control over their body
                    and behavior. A project called HANDS (Helping Autism
                    Diagnosed young people Navigate and Develop Socially) was
                    developed on mobile phone platform containing two main
                    application interfaces, one web based toolkit which is used by
                    teachers to design effective interfaces according to each child
                    then they can link that intervention on child’s mobile phone
                    so that he can easily interact with it. The project proved to be
                    very interactive for children suffering from Autism Spectrum
                    Disorder (ASD) and helped to changes their attitude towards
                    interaction.
                    Another technology that has been used extensively to affect
                    human behavior is text messages. Text message reminders
                    have been used in multiple domains to prompt individuals
                    towards certain desirable actions. For example, Karlan et al.
                    sent text message reminders to borrowers of certain microfinance
                    banks in the Philippines. They found that when the
                    text message included the name of the account officer’s name,
                    the message significantly, improved repayment. However, the
                    authors also suggest taking into account the context, market
                    characteristics and nature of institutions before designing ICT
                    interventions <a href="#reference19">[19]</a>. In another study, Castleman et al. found that
                    sending personalized text messages to low-income students
                    reminding them to finish tasks led to a 5.7 percentage point
                    increase in college enrollment from 66.4% to 72.1% <a href="#reference10">[10]</a>.
                    Similarly, the Behavioral Insights Team (BIT) sent a series of
                    text messages at regular intervals. This led to a fall in dropout
                    numbers at the end of the first semester by one third <a href=#reference11>[11]</a>.</p>
                    <h3>D. Farming</h3>
                    <p>Farming is another domain where the idea of nudge is
                    implemented to change the behavior of farmers who invest in
                    purchasing of fertilizers to yield their crops. The idea behind
                    this model is defined in <a href="#reference16">[16]</a>. The farmers usually invest in
                    purchasing fertilizers when government provide subsidies on
                    purchasing fertilizers but excess usage can damage the lands
                    as well. So they provided limited time discounts on purchase
                    of fertilizers during the time of harvest in the farms of Kenya
                    which caused much profitable outcome for farmers.</p>
                    <h3>E. Child Care</h3>
                    <p>The behavior change in child care is another area where
                    change in behavior is required so that it benefits the children.
                    It explains the architecture as behavioral mapping in which
                    there are several steps involved in this procedure starting
                    from finding the problem and then creating behavioral map
                    which involves initialization of the project, understanding the
                    problem, understanding the clients and then diagnosing the
                    solution <a href="#reference20">[20]</a>.</p>
                    <h3>F. Breaking Harmful Addictions</h3> 
                    <p>Internet can be used to persuade people behavior and give
                    them healthier life as it has power to motivate people to keep
                    a better lifestyle. The Internet-based resources such as webbased
                    applications help to make persuasive communication
                    among people. Web based platforms can provide immediate
                    feedback to people that help to add positive behavior, motivations
                    and beliefs at different times. In this study <a href="#reference27">[27]</a>,
                    they have highlighted how different interventions using web
                    based technologies can be used to persuade people to stop
                    using alcohol and quit smoking habits. The most common
                    methodologies include persuader which can be in the form
                    of messages being delivered to user, self-monitoring include
                    knowing one’s self behavior to change for a positive intervention,
                    simulation, personalization, tailoring and tunneling etc.</p>
                    <h3>G. Sustainability and Environmentalism</h3> 
                    <p>Human beings use technology resources for better lifestyle
                    but fully automated environment might result in frustration for
                    the user as it might tend to be less user-friendly. On the other
                    hand if technology has been built only using the behavioral
                    approaches, that also has not shown very good results as it
                    lacks many technical details in solution. To overcome the
                    above mentioned scenario, there should be an excellent bonding
                    between the technology and the user behavior. There are
                    four major roles of technology defined, namely, 1) technology
                    as <em>intermediary</em>; 2) technology as an <em>amplifier</em>; 3) technology
                    as a <em>determinant</em>; and 4) technology as a <em>promoter</em> <a href="#reference29">[29]</a>. In the
                    paper <a href="#reference29">[29]</a> the authors have investigated how technology can
                    be used as promoter to make people aware of using natural
                    resources in a sustainable way. They have shown that media
                    has provided a lot of persuasion by showing signs, sayings
                    directly to impact people to raise the environmental risk
                    awareness. Also, they have defined how persuasive technology
                    can be utilized to promote energy conservation by using
                    artificial intelligent agents that play their role as a social actor
                    to promote the positive behavioral change.
                    Using media resources to bring about behavioral change in
                    people may lead to an unsuccessful outcome if they developer
                    of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) omit the basic
                    principles of media-oriented awareness. In <a href="#reference4">[4]</a>, the authors
                    have identified some special guidelines for the campaign
                    designers to create public services messages. They highlighted
                    that the designers should initially identify the target audience
                    for their campaign and then test the reactions of audience
                    using pilot messages. The designers would also be required
                    to consider attitude persistence, memory and social norms to
                    create messages and presentations that influence audience.
                    Social norms as discussed earlier have great influence on
                    people behavior so the study was conducted, which resulted
                    in claiming that global warming and climate changes can be
                    reduced especially by studying certain area like conserving
                    daily energy consumption at one’s house and in offices, avoid
                    pollution on roads by using public transports and supporting
                    public policies set by government to reduce global warming.
                    This was achieved by using descriptive social norms which
                    are messages that influence people to behave under specific
                    conditions. The use of such norms by higher authorities can
                    effect people to change their behavior among bringing in
                    climate changes <a href="#reference21">[21]</a>.
                    To protect the environment using persuasive approach which
                    effects human behavior easily is to communicate using normative
                    messages. The use of such norms had a great effect on
                    people behavior towards protection of natural resources and
                    eco-friendly environment <a href="#reference12">[12]</a>. The experiment was conducted
                    by placing marked pieces of petrified wood along the path
                    for park visitors and had descriptive messages, which tells
                    what needs to be done in particular situation and second
                    are the injunctive messages, which state what is approved
                    or disapproved in particular situations. The result showed
                    that descriptive messages resulted in more theft of petrified
                    wood than injunctive norm messages. This approved that
                    the persuasive approach to guide people using norm-based
                    messages (descriptive or injunctive) effect the user behavior.</p>
                    <h3>H. Energy Use</h3>
                    <p>Saving energy is one of the key factors to provide clean
                    environment which is pollution free. The government can play
                    a vital role to make people behave more energy efficiently to
                    provide them healthier life. In <a href="#reference44">[44]</a> the authors have tested two
                    different approaches to get behavioral insights from people and
                    motivate them to ensure the saving of energy consumed. The
                    first method is to how UK government has encouraged people
                    to make their homes more green. This was done by giving
                    locals incentives and also providing special discounts on the
                    purchase of energy efficient household items at government
                    level. The second approach is use of social norms to address
                    people to be more energy savers. This was achieved by
                    comparison of energy consumption with other users in the
                    same vicinity. The government has also managed to limit
                    itself to reduce the energy consumption of all departments
                    by about 10% within one year. The overall approach helped
                    and motivated people to reduce energy consumption leading
                    to a well-pleased lifestyle. Other researchers have found that
                    making information easy to be accessed leads to people being
                    more likely to act on it. For example, an email that contains a
                    direct link to online energy information portal is much more
                    likely to prompt people to engage with the information.

                    <strong>Lessons from behavioral science ? seven steps to reduce
                    fraud, error and debt</strong><br/>
                    The seven insights below are all based on evidence from
                    behavioral science. They show that, by going with the
                    grain of how people behave, we can reduce the prevalence
                    of fraud, error and debt.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 1. Make it easy:</strong> Make it as straightforward as
                    possible for people to pay tax or debts, for example by
                    pre-populating a form with information already held.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 2. Highlight key messages:</strong> Draw people’s
                    attention to important information or actions required of
                    them, for example by highlighting them upfront in a letter.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 3. Use personal language:</strong> Personalize language
                    so that people understand why a message or process is
                    relevant to them.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 4. Prompt honesty at key moments:</strong> Ensure that
                    people are prompted to be honest at key moments when
                    filling in a form or answering questions.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 5. Tell people what others are doing:</strong> Highlight
                    the positive behaviour of others, for instance that ‘9 out of
                    10 people pay their tax on time’.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 6. Reward desired behaviour:</strong> Actively incentives
                    or reward behaviour that saves time or money.<br/>
                    <strong>Insight 7. Highlight the risk and impact of dishonesty:</strong>
                    Emphasize the impact of fraud or late payment on public
                    services, as well as the risk of audit and the consequences
                    for those caught.</aside></p>
                    <h3>I. Reducing Fraud, Error, and Debt</h3>
                    <p>Another important area where behavioral economics can
                    play its part and change people mind to avoid frauds and
                    negative attitude is reducing the frauds being committed.
                    According to one study <a href="#reference45">[45]</a>, the people in UK tend to stop
                    frauds, errors and debt because of the strong social norm there,
                    where people find it a very disgraceful to adopt one such</p>

                    <strong>Test, learn, adapt ? eight trials to reduce fraud, error
                    and debt</strong><br/>
                    <strong>Trial 1. Using social norms:</strong> investigates whether
                    informing people that the vast majority of those in their
                    area have already paid their tax can significantly boost
                    payment rates.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 2. Highlighting key messages and norms:</strong>
                    examines whether we can increase tax compliance among
                    doctors by simplifying the principal messages and actions
                    required, as well as using social levers and norms.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 3. Using salient images:</strong> investigates whether using
                    images captured by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
                    Agency can help to reduce unnecessary repeat
                    correspondence and encourage prompt payment of fines.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 4. Better presentation of information:</strong> explores
                    different ways of presenting information to discover which
                    is most effective at encouraging the payment of debts.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 5. Personalizing text messages:</strong> tests the impact of
                    sending more personalized text messages on people’s
                    propensity to pay court-ordered fines.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 6. Prompting honesty:</strong> examines whether
                    simplifying key messages, emphasizing the consequences
                    of fraud and getting people to sign forms upfront results in
                    more honest declarations.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 7. Varying the tone of letters:</strong> explores the
                    effectiveness of different types of communication in
                    encouraging plumbers to get their tax affairs up to date.<br/>
                    <strong>Trial 8. Using beliefs about tax:</strong> tests the effectiveness of
                    different messages ? related to the fact that most people
                    think that paying tax is the right thing to do ? on payment
                    of tax debts by companies.

                    PAKISTAN</h2>
                    <p>Pakistan is a country where there are many opportunities
                    available to overcome the situation like poor health, high death
                    rates and other social problems using persuasive methodology
                    and using technology as well. One of the major areas to
                    work using persuasive technology is in the domain of health,
                    agriculture and changing social behavior of people to yield
                    healthier and better lifestyle. Most of the countries including
                    US have worked for their social problems using persuasive
                    technology <a href="#reference4">[4]</a>[4] <a href="#reference6">[6]</a> <a href="#reference36">[36]</a> <a href="#reference46">[46]</a> .</p>
                    <h3>A. Improved Road Traffic Through Improved Driving Behavior></h3> 
                    <p>According to World Health Rankings website, the rate of
                    death caused in road accidents is about 20 per 100,000 people. <sup><button onclick="open_footnote_3()">3</button></sup>

                    The people who are injured in these situations is another count.
                    The number of people that are directly or indirectly affected
                    in the road accidents can be reduced by using the persuasive
                    technology and behavioral science.<br/>
                    Smartphones, which have now become the central computer
                    and communication devices in the lives of people around
                    the world, have been shown in the literature to be very
                    versatile in ICT for human development (ICTD) projects <a href="#reference2">[2]</a>
                    <a href="#reference37">[37]</a> <a href="#reference1">[1]</a>. Smartphones are especially well suited for capturing
                    data about the user’s behavior and for running persuasive
                    technology applications that can be utilized to change people’s
                    behavior positively. A number of applications like <em>Chick
                    Clique</em> <a href="#reference46">[46]</a>, <em>Fit4life</em> <a href="#reference36">[36]</a> have used smartphones as primary
                    source to promote healthy lifestyle among people.<br/>
                    In order to handle the issue of road accidents, different
                    organizations including several insurance companies started to
                    use persuasive technology as a tool to measure the behavior
                    of drivers on road and then trying to change the attitude of
                    drivers so that their driving is safe for environment as well
                    as themselves. This system is known as Mobile Telematics
                    System and major application which is developed by Cambridge
                    Mobile Telemetics is <em>DriveWell</em> <a href="#reference28">[28]</a>. The application

                    is introduced which gives instant feedback to drivers on road to promote safe
                    driving. The application aims to improve the driving pattern
                    of drivers by using scoring mechanism, every trip of driver is
                    recorded by application and then positive scores are assigned
                    for the trip according to safe driving, but if driving is judged
                    as unsafe, then negative scores will be given which will affect
                    driving of the person.<br/>
                    Based on these few above mentioned applications and to
                    handle this global problems faced by people during driving,
                    we aim to provide solution by building an Android based
                    application for Pakistan, which can monitor the driving pattern

                    the smartphone without diverting driver attention towards his
                    phone aiming to provide the minimum distraction during
                    driving. This application would follow Persuasive System
                    Design and will utilize a nudge architecture to incline drivers
                    towards responsible driving and away from rash driving. The
                    users would be able to share their scores with their peers and
                    ratings would be given so they would aim to get top of the
                    leader board by better performance on driving.<br/>
                    The aim of this application would be to provide safe journey
                    for Pakistan as other application related to the same scenario
                    are also built but they are operated by insurance companies
                    to track driving of their clients, and not by common people
                    themselves. This would be unique for country like Pakistan
                    where number of road accidents is increasing.</p>
                    <h3>B. Mobile Application Based Nudge framework For Education
                    About Immunization </h3>
                    <p>After sub-Saharan Africa, Pakistan has the highest infant
                    mortality rate. Extended Program of Immunization (EPI) in
                    Pakistan is a government initiative which controls and monitors
                    immunization in Pakistan. EPI suggests that 27% of these
                    deaths could be prevented through immunization. Disease like
                    Pneumonia are the leading cause of infant mortality which can
                    be easily averted through immunization. Most of these deaths
                    are caused on prima facie due to neglect but are also are rooted
                    in the disinformation disseminated through hearsay. Punjab
                    Information Technology Board has made EVACS system to
                    monitor the attendance of all vaccinators sent out in the
                    field. However there is acknowledgment that the completion
                    of vaccination courses has not improved. Parent used to
                    forget their children’s next vaccination date and for diseases
                    like measles which have significant time period between two
                    vaccination dates the dropout rates were high. <br/>
                    Large numbers of the premature births take place in rural
                    areas and the death rate is high however in urban areas most
                    of these births take place at tertiary care hospitals and the
                    survival rate is generally better for these children. As shown
                    in <a href="#child_death">figure3</a> there are numerous reasons for the cause of deaths
                    of children and major part include most fatalities caused by
                    premature deaths. Urbanization is growing in Pakistan and it
                    is estimated (United Nations Population Division) that, by the
                    end of 2025, nearly 50% of Pakistan population would be
                    living in cities. There are many reason for this, but the main
                    reason is that living in urban cities increases the chances of
                    better livelihood and access to better health and education
                    services. Accompanied with this trend of urbanization is the
                    growing number of urban smartphone users. Pakistan Startup
                    Report Estimates that there will be 110 smartphone users
                    in Pakistan by the end of 2018 (most of which are users of
                    affordable Android-based smartphones).<br/>
                    Our aim is to develop a smartphone application that not
                    only stores the date of the next vaccination but also educates
                    people about how to find the nearby Basic Health Unit (BHU)
                    or other vaccination agencies and how to check the expiry of
                    the vaccines. The most important aspect of the application
                    is to nudge the parent towards vaccinating their children by
                    message and videos from religious scholars and by streaming
                    vaccination date to Facebook account of the users. The main
                    focus of the application is to design the choice architecture
                    that makes the users involved in improving the child and its
                    mother’s health. Framing of the messages in the application</p>
                    <img src="imgarticles/A-sample-energy-bill-sent-by-company-Opower-to-consumers-that-displays-the-energy.ppm" alt="a bill showing consumed energy">
                    <p><a name="energy_bill">Fig. 4: A sample energy bill sent by company Opower to consumers that displays the energy consumed along with embedded
                    nudges towards more energy-efficient future behavior. Figure source: <a href="#reference44">[44]</a></p></a>
                    <p>are also very important. The framing of the messages in
                    the application would be such that the user is not alienated
                    and should be such that persuasion techniques are subtle and
                    motivate him to higher goals such as better education for his
                    child. The other important factor in designing this application
                    is that the social impact factor should also be taken into
                    account and the users of the application could identify with
                    his peers. The goal of the application thus is that through
                    Libertarian Paternalism guide the individual towards sets of
                    choices that lead to healthier life of his dependents.</p>
                    <h3>C. Limiting Energy Consumption</h3>
                    <p>Pakistan is growing at a fast pace and has a rapidly rising
                    population. The rise in population is stressing the infrastructural
                    capacity of Pakistan, particularly in the area of electricity
                    generation. Currently, the demand of electricity has far outstripped
                    the generational capacity of current infrastructure,
                    resulting in an average shortfall of 4,000 Megawatts. Due
                    to this massive energy deficit, the everyday life of Pakistani
                    citizens is significantly affected and it is common for urban
                    citizens to face up to 6–12 hours of <em>load shedding</em> <sup><button onclick="open_footnote_6()">6</button></sup> 
                    <span class="footnote" id="sixth_footnote" style="display:none"><sup>6</sup>Load shedding refers to the action of shedding excessive load above
                    generating capacity by interrupting electricity supply to consumers</span>
                    and rural areas suffer even more (18–21 hours of load shedding). While
                    the Government of Pakistan has initiated many projects in
                    recent times to improve the generational infrastructure, due
                    to the concomitant increase in the population and therefore
                    the user demand, it is anticipated that the practice of load
                    shedding may not be completely eliminated unless consumer
                    behavior is also transformed.<br/>
                    The use of persuasive technology and behavioral insights
                    can be profitable here as has been shown in previous efforts
                    in literature and practice (particularly, in the UK and US)
                    <a href="#reference44">[44]</a>. We can reduce the energy consumption substantially
                    by developing new social norms in which energy saving is
                    encouraged. Various techniques of influence and persuasion
                    can be utilized (e.g., comparison with other users in the
                    vicinity). The UK government has developed a Behavioral
                    Insights Team (also known as the Nudge Unit) <a href="#reference44">[44]</a> that has
                    been successful in encouraging people to make their homes
                    more green. This was done by giving people incentives and
                    also providing special discounts on the purchase of energy
                    efficient household items at government level.<br/>
                    As another example, A US-based company Opower<sup><button onclick="open_footnote_7()">7</button></sup> 
                    <span class="footnote" id="seventh_footnote" style="display:none"><sup>7</sup> <a href="http://www.opower.com">http://www.opower.com</a></span>
                    sends electricity and gas consumption reports to consumers by comparing
                    their usage with other costumers of similar household
                    usage. A snapshot of the power bill sent by Opower is shared
                    in <a href="#energy_bill">Figure 4</a>. This figure encapsulates an embedded nudge
                    towards more energy efficient behavior since potential benefits
                    are clearly shown and a more energy-efficient social norm
                    is emphasized by comparing the subscriber to other similar
                    subscribers. Users are also provided energy conservation tips
                    on their bills and this practice had a positive result and
                    people started to restrict their consumption by 2$ <a href="#reference3">[3]</a>. The
                    policy makers identified three major policies to help to achieve
                    the goal of saving energy. First is the financial help from
                    government, Second is providing users with incentives against
                    their consumption of gas and electricity and third is that
                    government should provide information disclosure regarding
                    the departments to promote more energy savings. The same
                    ideas can also be used to curb energy consumption and can
                    help mitigate the hard to resolve energy crisis.</p>

                <div id="opportunities_pitfalls"><h2>V. OPPORTUNITIES AND PITFALLS</h2>
                    <p>There are many issues regarding the use of persuasive
                    technology as a tool to modify human behavior. Few such
                    pitfalls and opportunities are described in this section.</p>
                    <h3>A. Ethics Issue:</h3>
                    <p>Nudging as it applied to make changes in behavior of
                    peoples might not prove to be ethical. The government rules
                    imposed to people might have negative effective on people and
                    they lack choices. for example, in case of giving defaults (a
                    type of nudge), there are no or limited choices for individuals
                    to choose from so it proves to be false choice for people.<br/>
                    The nudge or changes in choice architecture may not be
                    acceptable on ethical grounds as they tend to violate on three
                    major grounds which are welfare, autonomy and dignity of
                    people <a href="#reference42">[42]</a>. Other examples that might affect people include
                    Reminders, a nudge, but still it is like a warning, so it must
                    be clear that nudge should not impose incentives which are
                    merely wrong choices for people rather it must provide choices
                    which are acceptable on all ethical grounds as well. The use
                    of technology can be beneficial but if that is forced on people
                    as part of nudging, it becomes very complicated for people to
                    adopt to such technology. The usage of technology would let
                    us decide how to adopt that technology as an example The
                    most banal example from Bruno Latour, in reference to the
                    American National Rifle Association’s assertion that guns do
                    not kill people, but that it is people who kill people <a href="#reference50">[50]</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>B. Privacy Issues:</h3>
                    <p>The nudging can also lead to privacy issues as the data
                    collected from mobile phones like location to identify people’s
                    position and who is nearby them, the patterns of purchasing on
                    application stores enables the interest of people, the browsing
                    patterns of people identify what type of contents the user is
                    interested in, Social networking websites collect data of users
                    to know their interests and that leads to appropriate advertisement
                    contents being generated. All this private information can
                    be used by government and private agencies to keep record of
                    consumers when people do not know that they are already
                    sharing this sacred information over the Internet. This leads
                    to privacy violation under the umbrella of nudge <a href="#reference40">[40]</a>.</p>
                    <h3>C. Algorithmic Harms:</h3>
                    <p>Algorithms have been designed to provide facility to people
                    so that their complex problems can be solved within no time
                    but still such type of approach when applied in real world
                    environment could be a loss of people’s interest. As algorithms
                    written by Facebook and Google provide user’s confidential
                    data to these companies causing privacy issues. A real world
                    example is that there are many companies which are using
                    the algorithms for hiring or maybe firing individuals. The
                    decisions which need to be taken by humans solely depend
                    upon applied algorithms which might violate many of the
                    government regulations as well <a href="#reference48">[48]</a>. A book written by Cathy
                    O’Neil titled “Weapons of Math Destruction” <a href="#reference33">[33]</a> also aims to
                    shed light on the above mentioned dilemma. The author has
                    worked to provide people with enough knowledge that the
                    use of algorithmic approaches has negative effects on human
                    behavior as many wrong decisions could be the outcome of
                    these algorithms, however these algorithms, which are merely
                    mathematical models, should be much fair and they should
                    judge without bias but the reality is different as they lack many
                    emotional and psychological factors in making decisions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>D. Propaganda and Exploitation:</h3>
                    <p>Massive production of data has enabled huge data pools and
                    these technologies have contributed in massive production of
                    big data and computational practices that enable to produce
                    high quality results by measuring the shifts and trends using
                    tools and technologies. Computational politics is one of the
                    area which involves applying the computational models to
                    huge data sets which are derived from online and offline
                    sources of data to conduct political activities like electing,
                    opposing a candidate, or a government policy which is an
                    act of persuasion for all individuals. In <a href="#reference47">[47]</a>, the authors have
                    provided how computational politics combined with big data
                    and focus on the power of big data to help local public. In
                    another study <a href="#reference23">[23]</a>, it is conducted that how big data, which is
                    increasingly growing by massive production of data by users,
                    can be combined with artificial intelligence, a modernized
                    technique in computing in which the aim is to make everything
                    much intelligent by inducing the power to decide the matters
                    on behalf of machine itself. These latest trends in behavioral
                    science and technology are reshaping our society and taking
                    control in making decisions related to public affairs etc.</p>

                    <h2>VI. CONCLUSIONS</h2>
                    <p>In this paper, we have given a broad overview of how
                    persuasive technology can be used to facilitate human development,
                    particularly, in the setting of the developing world. After
                    providing a self-contained introduction to the background of
                    persuasive technology, and highlighting common applications
                    of persuasive technology in literature, we discuss the particular
                    case of Pakistan, a typical developing country in which there
                    is a need to change the behaviour of people in many sectors
                    of daily life. We present an insight into the unique problems
                    faced by Pakistan and present three applications (safe driving,
                    pro-vaccination nudging, and responsible energy consumption)
                    of how persuasive technologies can help improve human lives
                    in Pakistan. Finally, we note some pitfalls that may accompany
                    the use of persuasive technology for human development.</p>
